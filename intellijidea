= Way - from first "Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA" window, with "Open or Import"

1) Delete .idea dir if exists in dir              $ rm -rf .idea/    (WORKED 1/13/21 - USE THIS)
2) do 'mvn clean" in that dir (IMP)               $ mvn clean
3) from first "Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA" window, remove all LHS side entries, by clickinf faint cross mark on rhs
