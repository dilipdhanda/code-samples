TreeMap<K, V> is a sorted map in Java â€” it stores keys in ascending order by default (using their natural order
or a custom Comparator). Internally, it uses a Red-Black Tree (a balanced binary search tree).
All operations O(log n)
ðŸ§© Common use cases
- Keeping entries sorted by key (e.g., timestamps, names, IDs)
- Finding next / previous / range keys quickly
- When you need ordered iteration
- Implementing LRU-like structures or interval lookups
âœ… Summary
- TreeMap keeps keys sorted automatically.
- Slower than HashMap (O(log n) vs O(1)) but gives you ordering + range queries.
- Use it when ordering matters or when you need nearest / range lookups.

TreeMap is a good choice when you need a map whose entries are sorted by key, or when you need to retrieve keys
    in a sorted order.

HashMap stores its entries in a hash table and does not guarantee any specific order of the entries over time.
    The order can appear random and may change when items are inserted or removed.
    performance of HashMap operations (containsKey, get, put, remove) is typically O(1), assuming the hash function
    disperses the elements properly among the buckets. However, in the worst case (e.g., poor hash function
    leading to collisions), the performance can degrade to O(n).
    HashMap Suitable for cases where order doesn't matter, and fast access is important, O(1) for read, write, delete

TreeSet is implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree (usually a Red-Black Tree),
    which ensures that the tree remains balanced and maintains the logarithmic height.

LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order, and achieves this by using a doubly-linked list in addition to the
    hash table. Bit slower due to the linked list maintenance and more memory.
